# MVC2 7-Point Team Randomizer

This app will pick a randomized team in MVC2 based on the ![7-Point Team](https://twitter.com/jwonggg/status/1372059892270305280?lang=en) idea first proposed by ![Justing Wong](https://twitter.com/JWonggg) on 17 March 2021.

Originally, this was going to be a Python web app, but never found a way to publish it so just decided to publish this via GH Pages with traditional JavaScript. This gave me a great reason to learn JavaScript and luckily was not had at all.

For any suggestions or comments, please post under Issues.
